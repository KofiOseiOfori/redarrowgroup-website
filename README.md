# redarrowgroup-website
This is draft playground for buiding the website of a company called Red Arrow Group. I will be using html and css at the initial stages and then later hopefully javascript for some functionality.
I am going to start with the building blocks using html. Once that is done then some some colours and designs can be introduced using CSS
